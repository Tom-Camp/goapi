# API.TMC

This is a simple API using Docker, Go and Mongodb. It uses code from Cosmas Gikunju's [How to Set Up a Local Development Workflow with Docker for your Go Apps with MongoDB and Mongo Express](https://dev.to/itscosmas/how-to-set-up-a-local-development-workflow-with-docker-for-your-go-apps-with-mongodb-and-mongo-express-f99) and wachira_Dev's [Create API with Gin in Golang Part 1](https://dev.to/tesh254/create-api-with-gin-in-golang-part-1-i7d).

It is a starting point.
